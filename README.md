# codefest_website

to do - 
1. Typewriter effect on h3 heading-subtitle
2. Add the footer. It needs to have:
i. icons for social media links
ii. credits to developers
iii. a link to a page/pop-up window with the full codefest team's names and pictures (latter can be added later)
iv. copyright statement
v. button to create a pop up window/new page with terms and conditions of the competition (for content, check t&c in the assets dir)
3. Add an extra line on each theme card for product ideas related to the themes.
4. Add the mobile navbar (drop down menu). Have added the code which hides the existing navbar so far.
